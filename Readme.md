## Primary Task

### Product Requirements

- **Keep track of recipes for a kitchen.**  
  A recipe should consist of:
  - A list of ingredients
  - Instructions to combine those ingredients
  - Yield information (how much food the recipe produces)
- **Allow users to search for recipes**
- **Display recipes in a way that is easy for someone working in a kitchen to see/understand**
- **Allow users to edit or remove recipes**

### Architectural Requirements

- Needs to handle no more than **5,000 to 10,000 requests per day**
- Will store no more than **1,000 recipes**
- May have **several dozen users** across different (potentially competing) restaurants
- Don’t worry about things like internationalization

## Skeleton Out the System (Backend and Frontend)

- You can skeleton out authentication, but this doesn’t need to be implemented
- More concerned with seeing how you structure and test your code
- Consider error conditions and border cases, but stay within the time window!

## Deliverables

- **Design/architecture document** in your choice (markdown is perfectly fine)
- **Considerations or any interesting decisions** that went into your design choices (for example, maintainability, cost, language, etc)
- **Sending a GitHub link (or repo/source) and any screenshots**
